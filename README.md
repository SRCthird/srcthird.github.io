# SRCthird ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This repository capabilities of my technical skills through the selected artifacts, enhancements, and reflective narratives. It also begins with my professional self-assessment, which introduces me, my professional values, and how my portfolio supports my skills in the field.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has been both a pretty huge milestone. This process has allowed me to refine my technical skills, demonstrate measurable improvements to real artifacts, and present my strengths in ways that directly align with the expectations of the computer science industry. By reflecting on my growth and focusing on my strongest work, I am better prepared to contribute meaningfully as an engineer and developer.

### Program Strengths and Growth

Throughout the program, I developed strong abilities in **collaborating in a team environment**. In projects, I practiced Agile methodologies, estimation techniques, and version control workflows, ensuring accountability and smooth integration of multiple contributors’ code. This prepared me to work in professional development teams that value collaboration and adaptability.

I also strengthened my skills in **communicating with stakeholders** by gathering requirements, writing user stories, and documenting design choices. These experiences taught me how to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business needs, a skill I now use in my role as a Systems Engineer.

In **data structures and algorithms**, I grew from writing simple scripts to designing efficient search, filter, and indexing algorithms. For example, in my inventory filtering enhancement, I weighed the trade-offs between linear scans and indexed lookups, illustrating my ability to apply algorithmic thinking to improve performance and scalability.

In the area of **software engineering and database development**, I designed layered applications with clear separation of concerns. I worked extensively with SQLite and later enhanced my work by synchronizing with a remote MongoDB API. This evolution shows both my grasp of relational schema design and my adaptability with NoSQL systems.

Finally, I built a strong foundation in **security**. I applied secure coding practices by using parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks, enforced uniqueness constraints in my database schema, and explored at-rest encryption options like SQLCipher. These measures demonstrate my ability to design systems that prioritize data integrity and security.

### Portfolio Integration

The artifacts in this ePortfolio represent a unified progression of my skills.  
- The **Inventory Transfer feature** demonstrates my software engineering and design capabilities.  
- The **Search/Filter/List feature** highlights my application of algorithms and data structures to enhance efficiency and user experience.  
- The **Local Persistence Layer** illustrates my understanding of databases, migrations, and synchronization with external APIs.  

Together, these artifacts form a comprehensive picture of my growth as a developer. They showcase not only my technical proficiency but also my ability to reflect critically, enhance existing work, and align solutions with professional standards.

### Professional Goals

My goal is to continue developing as a systems engineer with a focus on building reliable, secure, and scalable applications. The skills I have demonstrated—team collaboration, communication, algorithmic thinking, database optimization, and secure engineering—are directly transferable to industry challenges. This portfolio demonstrates that I am prepared to contribute to projects that require both strong technical implementation and thoughtful design.
